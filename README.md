clipboard_dispatcher
====================

Chrome extension that allows execution of arbitrary actions on users' computer via clipboard manipulation.

It adds a right-click menu to images/pages and enables you to execute arbitrary action on image/page URL (send via skype to friend etc). 
I use it to send links to friends via skype and google-talk (saves me time to copy-paste).
It requires small daemon running on users' computer to integrate with skype and google-talk.
